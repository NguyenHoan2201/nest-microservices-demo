# NestJS REST API + Apache Kafka Microservices

This project is a monorepo managed by [nx](https://nx.dev) workspace, it contains a REST API with microservices using [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as message broker and it is built with the [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com) framework.  

The project is meant for learning and evaluation purposes only. However, it could also be used to bootstrap live projects.

## Tech Stack
* [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [KafkaJS](https://kafka.js.org/)
* [Nx](https://nx.dev/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Architecture Overview

The project currently consists of the following components:

1. API Gateway (AG): this sits in front of all microservices and listens to requests from external client, it calls the appropriate microservice(s) to process the request and sends responses back to external clients.

2. User microservice: this microservice handles all CRUD requests for users received from the API gateway and other microservices and returns appropriate responses.

3. Payment microservice: this microservice handles payment-processing operations received from the API gateway, it communicates with the user-microservice to get the required user data to process the request and returns appropriate responses to the API gateway.

4. Message Broker: Apache Kafka is used here to manage AG-microservices and inter-services communication.

5. Databases: all microservices are isolated from each other and are designed to have their own separate database as required.

The application could be easily scaled, and more microservices added as required.

## Running the individual component

```
# running AG or any microservice
nx serve api-gateway
nx serve user-microservice
nx serve payment-microservice

# adding a new microservice
nx g @nrwl/nest:app microservice-name

```
